# Goober Net Ease

Dumb orchestration tool for coordinating development and deployment of microservices. This will provide environment values to services in the same manner as Kubernetes. With this, we can run dev/staging instances, etc, on a single instance, and then deploy to a cluster seemlessly.

Or something.
